# Travel Destinations
A simple app to keep track of destinations I'd like to visit.

# Description
This project was used as a training resource for learning Git and GitHub.  Specifically, it was used to demonstrate how multiple people can contribute to a single repository.  Here it was used to show how a group of friends could update the same repository with their own requested vacation destinations.
